          <h2>Using the AI Assistant</h2>
          <p>
            The AI assistant is one of the most powerful features of our platform. Here's how to use it effectively to enhance your learning:
          </p>

          <h3>Asking Questions</h3>
          <p>
            You can ask the AI assistant any questions related to the current topic you're learning. The assistant has
            access to the course content and can provide detailed explanations.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Best Practices for Effective Questions:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Be specific about what concept you need help with</li>
            <li>Mention your current understanding level to get appropriate explanations</li>
            <li>Ask for examples if theoretical explanations aren't clear</li>
            <li>Request step-by-step breakdowns for complex processes</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Modifying Content</h3>
          <p>
            If you find the content too difficult, too easy, or want it in a different format, you can ask the AI to
            modify it. Here are some effective requests you can make:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>"Can you explain this in simpler terms?"</li>
            <li>"Change the language to Hindi"</li>
            <li>"Give me more practical examples of this concept"</li>
            <li>"Make this content more advanced - I already understand the basics"</li>
            <li>"Explain this like I'm 10 years old"</li>
            <li>"Can you provide more visual explanations?"</li>
            <li>"I need more details about [specific concept]"</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The AI will ask for confirmation before making significant changes to ensure it's what you want.</p>

          <h2>Course Navigation and Structure</h2>
          
          <h3>Detailed Course Index</h3>
          <p>
            Each course has a comprehensive index that provides a complete overview of all topics covered. You can access this by clicking the "Course
            Index" button at the top of any course page.

          </ol>
          
          <p><strong>Important:</strong> If you don't pass an assessment, you won't be able to proceed to the next topic. The system will automatically 
          prompt you to retake the assessment when you try to move forward.</p>
